# Sample-Projects
Folders containing different projects across my web development journey.

The files here can be accessed as intended by using VSCODE and Opening a Live server with the extension "Live Server" v5.6.1 by Ritwick Dey.

-save the project files
-pick a project and open its folder using vscode
-right click on the html file and select "Open With Live Server"
That should open it on the browser.

------------------------------
Check some of my projects made using Vue/React JS

To serve locally:
  -in terminal, "npm install -g serve"
  -then "serve -s"

------------------------------
*Update*
Or just open the links here:

-Some of these are very basic, but some are projects I'm quite fond of.
